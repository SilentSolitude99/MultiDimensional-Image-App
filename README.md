# Tayyip-Ahmet-Bakar
This repository contains a MATLAB-based image processing application that performs histogram equalization, edge detection, Gaussian blur, and median blur. The app also displays the histogram of the processed images and allows users to upload and save images directly to their desktop.
Overview:
This MATLAB-based Image Processing App is designed to perform a variety of image processing tasks with ease and efficiency. The app offers features like histogram equalization, edge detection, Gaussian blur, and median blur, making it a versatile tool for enhancing and analyzing images.

Features
Histogram Equalization: Improve the contrast of your images by redistributing the brightness levels to span the entire range.
Edge Detection: Identify and highlight the edges within an image, useful for detecting object boundaries and features.
Gaussian Blur: Apply Gaussian blur to your images to reduce noise and detail, creating a smoothing effect.
Median Blur: Use median filtering to reduce noise while preserving the edges, ideal for removing salt-and-pepper noise.
Histogram Display: Visualize the histogram of the processed images to better understand the distribution of pixel intensities.
Image Upload and Save: Easily upload images for processing and save the output images directly to your desktop.
